Small Image Search Engine using NN
I give credit to Tokyo University’s Dr. Matsui for the original work, which I used as reference. I used the VGG-19 model neural net on pre-trained weights. The VGG-19 is a popular 19 layers-deep neural net available in the keras library, which sources its images from the ImageNet database and is widely used for image classification and other tasks. The training set was ImageNet database images, while images from the CIFAR-10 dataset was used for the testing set and the query image. Testing set images’ features and the query image features are respectively extracted from the output layer of the neural net using the predict method from the tensorflow library. These features are the predictions of the neural net’s computation. Euclidean distance (Euclidean norm) between testing set features and query image features is found using the norm method from the numpy library. The set of smallest distances between either set of features can hence be found. Among these, the smallest 8 distances are found. Now, comparing these distances with images in the entire testing set one at a time, we can find the 8 images in the testing set which match these corresponding 8 distances respectively. Finally, these 8 matched images are the closest images to the query image in terms of resemblance.
